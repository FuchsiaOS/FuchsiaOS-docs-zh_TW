# Glossary


## Overview

The purpose of this document is to provide short definitions for a collection of technical terms
used in the Fuchsia source tree.

#### Adding new definitions

- A definition should be limited to two or three sentences and deliver a high-level description of a
term.
- When another non-trivial technical term needs to be employed as part of the description,
consider adding a definition for that term and linking to it from the original definition.
- A definition should be complemented by a list of links to more detailed documentation and related
topics.


## Terms

#### **Agent**

A component whose life cycle is not tied to any story, is a singleton in user scope, and provides
services to other components. An agent can be invoked by other components or by the system in
response to triggers like push notifications. An agent can provide services to components, send and
receive messages, and make proposals to give suggestions to the user.

#### **AppMgr**

The Application Manager (AppMgr) is responsible for launching components and managing the namespaces
in which those components run. It is the first process started in the `fuchsia` job by the [DevMgr]
(#DevMgr).

#### **Armadillo**

An implementation of a session shell.
- [Source](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/topaz/+/master/shell/armadillo/)

#### **Base shell**

The platform-guaranteed set of software functionality which provides a basic user-facing interface
for boot, first-use, authentication, escape from and selection of session shells, and device recovery.

#### **Component**

A component is a unit of execution and accounting. It consists of a manifest file and associated
code, which comes from a Fuchsia package. A component runs in a sandbox, accesses objects via its
[namespace](#Namespace) and publishes objects via its export directory. [Modules](#Module) and
[Agents](#Agent) are examples of components. Components are most commonly distributed inside
[Fuchsia Packages](#fuchsia-package).

#### **Component manifest**

A component manifest (.cmx) is a JSON file with the file extension `.cmx`, typically located in the
packageâ€™s `meta/` directory with information that declares how to run the component and what
capabilities it receives upon launch. In particular, the component manifest describes how the
component is sandboxed. See [Component manifest](the-book/package_metadata.md#Component-manifest)
for a detailed description.

These files end in `.cmx`, so they are also known as "cmx files".

#### **Channel**

A Channel is the fundamental IPC primitive provided by Zircon.  It is a bidirectional, datagram-like
transport that can transfer small messages including [Handles](#Handle).
- [Channel Overview](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/zircon/+/master/docs/objects/channel.md)

#### **DevHost**

A Device Host (DevHost) is a process containing one or more device drivers.  They are created by the
Device Manager, as needed, to provide isolation between drivers for stability and security.

#### **DevMgr**

The Device Manager (DevMgr) is responsible for enumerating, loading, and managing the life cycle of
device drivers, as well as low level system tasks (providing filesystem servers for the boot
filesystem, launching [AppMgr]( #AppMgr), and so on).

#### **DDK**

The Driver Development Kit is the documentation, APIs, and ABIs necessary to build Zircon Device
Drivers.  Device drivers are implemented as ELF shared libraries loaded by Zircon's Device Manager.
- [DDK Overview](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/zircon/+/master/docs/ddk/overview.md)
- [DDK includes](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/zircon/+/master/system/ulib/ddk/include/ddk/)

#### **Driver**

A driver is a dynamic shared library which [DevMgr](#DevMgr) can load into a [DevHost](#DevHost)
and that enables, and controls one or more devices.
- [Reference](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/zircon/+/master/docs/ddk/driver-development.md)
- [Driver Sources](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/zircon/+/master/system/dev)

#### **Environment**

A container for a set of components, which provides a way to manage their lifecycle and provision
services for them. All components in an environment receive access to (a subset of) the
environment's services.

#### **Escher**

Graphics library for compositing user interface content. Its design is inspired by modern real-time
and physically based rendering techniques though we anticipate most of the content it renders to
have non-realistic or stylized qualities suitable for user interfaces.

#### **FAR**

The Fuchsia Archive Format is a container for files to be used by Zircon and Fuchsia.
- [FAR Spec](the-book/archive_format.md)

#### **fdio**

fdio is the Zircon IO Library.  It provides the implementation of posix-style open(), close(),
read(), write(), select(), poll(), etc, against the RemoteIO RPC protocol.  These APIs are return-
not-supported stubs in libc, and linking against libfdio overrides these stubs with functional
implementations.
- [Source](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/zircon/+/master/system/ulib/fdio/)

#### **FIDL**

The Fuchsia Interface Definition Language (FIDL) is a language for defining protocols for use over
[Channels](#channel). FIDL is programming language agnostic and has bindings for many popular
languages, including C, C++, Dart, Go, and Rust. This approach lets system components written in a
variety of languages interact seamlessly.

#### **Flutter**

[Flutter](https://flutter.io/) is a functional-reactive user interface framework optimized for
Fuchsia and is used by many system components. Flutter also runs on a variety of other platform,
including Android and iOS. Fuchsia itself does not require you to use any particular language or
user interface framework.

#### **Fuchsia Package**

A Fuchsia Package is a unit of software distribution. It is a collection of files, such as:
manifests, metadata, zero or more executables (e.g. [Components](#component)), and assets.

#### **FVM**

Fuchsia Volume Manager is a partition manager providing dynamically allocated groups of blocks known
as slices into a virtual block address space. The FVM partitions provide a block interface enabling
filesystems to interact with it in a manner largely consistent with a regular block device. -
[Filesystems](the-book/filesystems.md)

#### **Garnet**

Garnet is one of the four layers of the Fuchsia codebase.
- [The Fuchsia layer cake](development/source_code/layers.md)
- [Source](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/garnet/+/master)

#### **GN**

GN is a meta-build system which generates build files so that Fuchsia can be built with [Ninja]
(#ninja). GN is fast and comes with solid tools to manage and explore dependencies. GN files, named
`BUILD.gn`, are located all over the repository.
- [Language and operation](https://gn.googlesource.com/gn/+/master/docs/language.md)
- [Reference](https://gn.googlesource.com/gn/+/master/docs/reference.md)
- [Fuchsia build overview](development/build/overview.md)

#### **Handle**

A Handle is how a userspace process refers to a [kernel object](#Kernel-Object). They can be passed
to other processes over [Channel](#Channel)s.
- [Reference](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/zircon/+/HEAD/docs/handles.md)

#### **Hub**

The hub is a portal for introspection.  It enables tools to access detailed structural information
about realms and component instances at runtime, such as their names, job and process ids, and
published services.
- [Hub](the-book/hub.md)

#### **Jiri**

Jiri is a tool for multi-repo development. It is used to checkout the Fuchsia codebase. It supports
various subcommands which makes it easy for developers to manage their local checkouts.

- [Tips and tricks](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/jiri/+/master/howdoi.md)

#### **Job**

A Job is a [kernel object](#Kernel-Object) that groups a set of related processes, their child
processes and their jobs (if any). Every process in the system belongs to a job and all jobs form
a single rooted tree.
- [Job Overview](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/zircon/+/master/docs/objects/job.md)

#### **Kernel Object**

A kernel object is a kernel data structure which is used to regulate access to system resources
such as memory, i/o, processor time and access to other processes. Userspace can only reference
kernel objects via [Handles](#Handle).
- [Reference](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/zircon/+/HEAD/docs/objects.md)

#### **Ledger**

[Ledger](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/peridot/+/master/docs/ledger/README.md) is a distributed
storage system for Fuchsia. Applications use Ledger either directly or through state synchronization
primitives exposed by the Modular framework that are based on Ledger under-the-hood.

#### **LK**

Little Kernel (LK) is the embedded kernel that formed the core of the Zircon Kernel. LK is more
microcontroller-centric and lacks support for MMUs, userspace, system calls -- features that Zircon
added.
- [LK on Github](https://github.com/littlekernel/lk)

#### **Maxwell**

Services to expose ambient and task-related context, suggestions and infrastructure for leveraging
machine intelligence.

#### **Module**

A component with a `module` metadata file which primarily describes the Module's data compatibility
and semantic role.

Modules show UI and participate in Stories at runtime.
- [module metadata format](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/peridot/+/HEAD/docs/modular/manifests/module.md)

#### **Mozart**

The view subsystem. Includes views, input, compositor, and GPU service.

#### **Musl**

Fuchsia's standard C library (libc) is based on Musl Libc.
- [Source](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/zircon/+/master/third_party/ulib/musl/)
- [Musl Homepage](https://www.musl-libc.org/)

#### **Namespace**

A namespace is the composite hierarchy of files, directories, sockets, [service](#Service)s, and
other named objects which are offered to components by their [environment](#Environment).
- [Fuchsia Namespace Spec](the-book/namespaces.md)

#### **Netstack**

TODO(tkilbourn): add definition.

#### **Ninja**

Ninja is the build system executing Fuchsia builds. It is a small build system with a strong
emphasis on speed. Unlike other systems, Ninja files are not supposed to be manually written but
should be generated by other systems, such as [GN](#gn) in Fuchsia.
- [Manual](https://ninja-build.org/manual.html)
- [Ninja rules in GN](https://gn.googlesource.com/gn/+/master/docs/reference.md#ninja_rules)
- [Fuchsia build overview](development/build/overview.md)

#### **Package**

Package is an overloaded term. Package may refer to a [Fuchsia Package](#fuchsia-package) or a [GN
build package](#GN).

#### **Paver**

A tool in Zircon that installs partition images to internal storage of a device.
- [Guide for installing Fuchsia with paver](/development/workflows/paving.md).

#### **Peridot**

Peridot is one of the four layers of the Fuchsia codebase.
- [The Fuchsia layer cake](development/source_code/layers.md)
- [Source](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/peridot/+/master)

#### **Realm**

Synonym for [environment](#environment).

#### **RemoteIO**

RemoteIO is the Zircon RPC protocol used between fdio (open/close/read/write/ioctl) and filesystems,
device drivers, etc.  As part of [FIDL](#FIDL) v2, it will become a set of FIDL Interfaces (File,
Directory, Device, ...) allowing easier interoperability, and more flexible asynchronous IO for
clients or servers.

#### **Service**

A service is an implementation of a [FIDL](#FIDL) interface. Components can offer their creator a
set of services, which the creator can either use directly or offer to other components.

Services can also be obtained by interface name from a [Namespace](#namespace), which lets the
component that created the namespace pick the implementation of the interface. Long-running
services, such as [Mozart](#mozart), are typically obtained through a [Namespace](#namespace),
which lets many clients connect to a common implementation.

#### **Story**

A user-facing logical container encapsulating human activity, satisfied by one or more related
modules. Stories allow users to organize activities in ways they find natural, without developers
having to imagine all those ways ahead of time.

#### **Story Shell**

The system responsible for the visual presentation of a story. Includes the presenter component,
plus structure and state information read from each story.

#### **Topaz**

Topaz is one of the four layers of the Fuchsia codebase.
- [The Fuchsia layer cake](development/source_code/layers.md)
- [Source](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/topaz/+/master)

#### **Session Shell**

The replaceable set of software functionality that works in conjunction with devices to create an environment in which people can interact with mods, agents and suggestions.

#### **VDSO**

The VDSO is a Virtual Shared Library -- it is provided by the [Zircon](#Zircon) kernel and does not
appear in the filesystem or a package.  It provides the Zircon System Call API/ABI to userspace
processes in the form of an ELF library that's "always there." In the Fuchsia SDK and [Zircon DDK]
(#DDK) it exists as `libzircon.so` for the purpose of having something to pass to the linker
representing the VDSO.

#### **VMAR**

A Virtual Memory Address Range is a Zircon [kernel object](#Kernel-Object) that controls where and
how VMOs may be mapped into the address space of a process.
- [VMAR Overview](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/zircon/+/master/docs/objects/vm_address_region.md)

#### **VMO**

A Virtual Memory Object is a Zircon [kernel object](#Kernel-Object) that represents a collection of
pages (or the potential for pages) which may be read, written, mapped into the address space of a
process, or shared with another process by passing a [Handle](#Handle) over a [Channel](#Channel).
- [VMO Overview](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/zircon/+/master/docs/objects/vm_object.md)

#### **Zedboot** ####

Zedboot is a recovery image that is used to install and boot a full Fuchsia system. Zedboot is
actually an instance of the Zircon kernel with a minimal set of drivers and services running used to
bootstrap a complete Fuchsia system on a target device. Upon startup, Zedboot listens on the network
for instructions from a bootserver which may instruct Zedboot to [install](#paver) a new OS. Upon
completing the installation Zedboot will reboot into the newly installed system.

#### **Zircon**

Zircon is the [microkernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microkernel) and lowest level userspace
components (driver runtime environment, core drivers, libc, etc) at the core of Fuchsia.  In a
traditional monolithic kernel, many of the userspace components of Zircon would be part of the
kernel itself. Zircon is also one of the four layers of the Fuchsia codebase.
- [Zircon Documentation](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/zircon/+/master/README.md)
- [Zircon Concepts](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/zircon/+/master/docs/concepts.md)
- [The Fuchsia layer cake](development/source_code/layers.md)
- [Source](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/zircon/+/master)

#### **ZX**

ZX is an abbreviation of "Zircon" used in Zircon C APIs/ABIs (`zx_channel_create()`, `zx_handle_t`,
`ZX_EVENT_SIGNALED`, etc) and libraries (libzx in particular).

#### **ZXDB**

The native low-level system debugger.
