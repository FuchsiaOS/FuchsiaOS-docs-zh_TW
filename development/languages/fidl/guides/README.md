# The FIDL Guides

This is a placeholder for Guides.
Our goal here is to provide a language-agnostic (high-level) view of
various use cases for FIDL, such as:

* error codes using FIDL enums
* IP addresses using FIDL unions
* fire-and-forget messages (for example, for configuration)
* RPC style messages (when you need to wait for the reply)
* notifications (when you want to receive messages asynchronously)
