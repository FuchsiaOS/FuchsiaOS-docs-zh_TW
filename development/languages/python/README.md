# Python

Python is a scripting language from [python.org](https://python.org/).

## Versions 2 and 3

Python has been migrating from Python 2 to Python 3. We are not yet ready to
drop support for Python 2. Until that time, scripts should support both
versions. See [Fuchsia Python style guide](python_style.md) for details.
